## Do you want control of your data? 

Astronomer delivers your user event data to your data warehouse, giving you the power to analyze that data alongside your other business data, using modern business intelligence tools.

<span style="color:#F0471C;">Today, accomplishing this objective involves expensive SaaS services, custom software development, and ongoing monitoring/maintenance.</span>

## Our vision

Astronomer delivers **user event data** from your apps directly into **your data warehouse**, so you can analyze it however you want.

* **Enterprise-grade data collection plugins** — flexible, open-source, for all major app frameworks, and allow you to use your own domain as the endpoint, to mitigate the web tracking tipping point.
* **Flexible, reliable data hub** — built entirely with burstible services from Amazon Web Services, this service glues everything together in a robust and secure way. All inbound events are automatically archived in raw form forever. You can use this archive to replay historical data on demand as you evolve what you want to do with the data.
* **Broadcast integrations** — open-source integrations with common third-party services that can be customized and tailored to your needs.
* **Data warehouse integrations** — open-source integrations for top data warehouses: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Hadoop (Cloudera/ Hive), Oracle, HP Vertica, SAP Hana, Snowflake, and IBM DashDB. These integrations can be used “off-the-shelf” or can be customized.
* **Data processing** — open-source procedures to build summarized, aggregated data to make it easier to consume this data from your Business Intelligence tools. These procedures can be used “off-the-shelf” or can be customized. You can even upload your own custom procedures.

The businesses that have apps that generate millions of user events each month tell us this solution is “spot on.”

<span style="color:#F0471C;">Earlier-stage companies can also use Astronomer, because it can be used out-of-the-box to simply collect data and broadcast to popular analytics tools — the data warehousing features can be enabled later.</span>

## Our current product

Currently, we help **javascript apps** send data to **Amazon Redshift**, and we also can broadcast your data to 15 third-party tools: Amplitude, Calq, Customer.io, Google Analytics, Heap, Intercom, Keen IO, Kissmetrics, Klayvio, Librato, Lifecycle, Lytics, Mixpanel, Vero, and Woopra.

## Automatic app instrumentation experiment

We believe that setting up user analytics is currently way harder than it needs to be. We built a [Meteor package](https://atmospherejs.com/astronomerio/core) that can be used to automatically emit well-formed user events from any Meteor app.
